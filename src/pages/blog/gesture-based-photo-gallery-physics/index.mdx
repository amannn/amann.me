excerpt: Exploring the usage of physical spring equations for animations.

import Figure from 'components/Figure';
import PhoneFrame from 'components/PhoneFrame';

When animating elements, I think they should closely resemble phsyical objects
from the real world. For this prototype I used spring equations in order to get
a natural acceleration and deceleration feeling.

<Figure>
  <PhoneFrame screenBackgroundColor="#201423">
    <video
      autoPlay
      loop
      preload="auto"
      width="100%"
      style={{maxHeight: '70vh'}}
    >
      <source src={require('./demo.mp4')} type="video/mp4" />
      Sorry, your browser doesn't support embedded videos.
    </video>
  </PhoneFrame>
</Figure>

Try the [live demo](https://amannn.github.io/photo-gallery/).

I think for animations which are based on single clicks or
taps you can get pretty far with CSS transitions. However as soon as a user
moves elements via touch gestures you need something much more dynamic.

Elements should precisely follow touch movements and if a finger is released in the
middle of a pan gesture, the element should continue that motion while a natural
friction brings the object to a smooth halt.

There's an animation loop which runs 60 times a second and which incorporates
velocity into coordinates of the photos using a [symbolic integration of Hooke's
law](https://www.stewartcalculus.com/data/CALCULUS%20Concepts%20and%20Contexts/upfiles/3c3-AppsOf2ndOrders_Stu.pdf).

[Ralph Thomas](https://github.com/iamralpht) got me really interested in using physical models for animations.
If you find this interesting, I can't recommend these two articles enough:
[Creating Animations and Interactions with Physical
Models](http://iamralpht.github.io/physics/) and [Towards declarative touch interactions
](http://iamralpht.github.io/constraints/).

The [physics
utilities](https://github.com/amannn/photo-gallery/tree/master/src/utils/physics)
for this experiment are based on [the implementation of Ralph
Thomas](https://github.com/iamralpht/iamralpht.github.io/tree/master/physics).

**Update:** There's now a small library called
[wobble](https://github.com/skevy/wobble) which implements spring physics. If
that's all you need, this is your place to go.
