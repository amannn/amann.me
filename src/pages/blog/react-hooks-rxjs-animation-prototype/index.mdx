excerpt: Are these technologies are a good fit for gesture-based animations?

import PhoneFrame from 'components/PhoneFrame';

The introduction of React Hooks got me excited to try them out on an animation
prototype. Such apps tend to have quite a bit of side effects if you don't use
an abstraction which takes care of that. Also from my experience building
fancy animations usually makes code harder to read. That's why I thought it might be
interesting to see if Hooks are a good fit for this.

The app is based on a [dribble
shot](https://dribbble.com/shots/2189808-Imitating-UIKit-dynamics-physics) by
[@tmgrhm](https://twitter.com/tmgrhm). It's a concept which shows relations
between a person and her friends.

<Figure>
  <PhoneFrame>
    <video autoPlay loop preload="auto" style={{maxHeight: '70vh'}}>
      <source src={require('./demo.mp4')} type="video/mp4" />
      Sorry, your browser doesn't support embedded videos.
    </video>
  </PhoneFrame>

I initially tried running the animation loop via `setState`, but that turned out
to be too slow. Therefore I wanted something that bypasses React altogether for
my animation purposes: [RxJS](https://rxjs-dev.firebaseapp.com/). Observables
are interesting for gestures where a single touch movement controls multiple effects.

In my case I'm reading `scrollTop` on every animation frame, feed that into a
stream which all animatable elements subscribe to and transform it as necessary.
Reading `scrollTop` via `requestAnimationFrame` produces better results in
comparison to a scroll listener, as the latter can fire too often which will
cause jank. Therefore every frame starts with a single read operation from the DOM
followed by a few write operations. That avoids [layout
thrashing](https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/performance/rendering/avoid-large-complex-layouts-and-layout-thrashing)
and reduces CPU work.

Using Hooks felt a bit unusual too me at first, but overall I liked the idea.
Especially having another tool in the box to create abstractions for shared
behaviour looks promising to me, leading to [slimmer
components](https://twitter.com/jamannnnnn/status/1057025220362543116). Also
`useEffect` is just amazing in comparison to `component{DidMount,DidUpdate,WillUnmount}`.
